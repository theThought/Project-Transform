# v1.65 release

Two new features are available in this release:
- a new faster drodown control
- a new faster combobox control

These are NOT updates of the existing controls, those still exist and can still be used.  These are two new controls and so they have been given new ZIndex numbers.

## DropDown
The new dropdown is based on a <select> tag in HTML, the base input is a <select> tag which includes <option> tags for each of the options in the list.  The control of a <select> tag is limited from a presentation perspective the control is managed by the operating system and so is not consistent across browser (even if those browsers are based on Webkit).  The <select> tag comes with features for free.  This includes the selection mechanism where typing will select an option based on a "starts-with" algorithm.

The following is a simple example of a dropdown implementation:

### metadata:
```
FullPaperList ""
    define
    {
        Sun "Sun",
        Mail "The Daily Mail",
        Express "Daily Express",
        Mirror "The Mirror",
        Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph",
        Independent "The Independent",
        Guardian "Guardian",
        Star "Daily Star",
        Times "The Times",
        I "i",
        Metro "Metro",
        Post "The Washington Post",
        LeMonde "Le Monde",
        Journal "The Wall Street Journal",
        STimes "Sunday Times",
        Observer "Observer",
        STelegraph "Sunday Telegraph"
    } asc;

DropPapers "Which of the following daily newspapers is your favourite"
    style(
        ZIndex = -65,
        Width = "12em",
        Control(
            Type = "DropList"
        )
    )
categorical [1..1]
{
    use FullPaperList sublist -
    asc
};
```

Note:
The ControlType must be droplist (as this stops the generation of radio buttons and ensures that a whole question's content in held in a single cell within a grid).
The ZIndex is -65 (select dropdown) rather than -60 (choice dropdown)

### routing:
At this time, the custom properties for select dropdown and choice dropdown are the same, however the jumptofirstletter property is redundant and will be deprecated later

Showanswers is out of scope for this version and may also be deprecated as it is for supporting multi-choice droplists which can not be supported by a select based dropdown
```
AddCustomProperties(DropPapers, "DropPapers", "{'displayicon':true,'jumptofirstletter':true,'listsize':10,'showanswers':false,'type':'dropdown','placeholder':''}", "replace")
DropPapers.ask()
```

## Combo-box
This question type is implemented as a input-box (into which the user can type a search expression), a hidden input box where the selected item is stored, and a unordered list which is formatted to look like a select list.

The structure of the question is similar to the previous choice combo-box but the question type (as defined by ZIndex) is different.  The custom properties are, at the current time, the same.

### metadata
```
new_productslist ""
    define
    {
        first "I am always among the first to prescribe a new product",
        waitShort "I like to wait a while (for a few months) after a new product is approved before I start prescribing it",
        waitMedium "I wait to be comfortable (for more than a few months) with a new product by speaking to colleagues, hearing about its success before I prescribe it",
        waitLong "I prefer to prescribe products that are tried and trusted",
        reluctant "I am very reluctant to prescribe new products/switch to new products"
    } asc;

ComboNewProducts "Which of these products best fits your needs"
        style(
            ZIndex = -60,
            Control(
                Type = "DropList"
            )
        )
    categorical [1..1]
    {
        use new_productslist sublist -
        asc
    };
```

Note:
The ControlType must be droplist (as this stops the generation of radio buttons and ensures that a whole question's content in held in a single cell within a grid).
The ZIndex is -68 (combo-box) rather than -60 (choice combo-box)

### routing
At this time, the custom properties for combo-box and choice combo-box are the same, however displayicon is not currently implemented.  It may be implemented later

Showanswers is out of scope for this version it is not required until support of multi-choice combo-boxes is implemented
Only the filtertype "starts" is implemented at this time

```
AddCustomProperties(ComboNewProducts, "ComboNewProducts", "{'displayicon':true,'onesize':{'state':true},'listsize':10,'showanswers':false,'type':'combobox','mincharactersforlist':1,'notenoughcharacters':'You need to type at least one character of the required drug for options to be listed','filtertype':'starts','placeholder':'','otherquestion':'', 'noitemsinlist':'no items match this filter'}", "replace")
ComboNewProducts.Ask()
```

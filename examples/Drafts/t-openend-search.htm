                The class name is wrong the class for the none asset should be a-tag-none and the class for the selected answer should be m-tag-answer
    
                I am not entirely convinced by the None (in the design it does not look right and it has no real value) so we could drop this
    
                m-tag-answer will include the text in the input at the point the user selected an option or clicked the tick button. 
                It will also include a cross button to allow the tag to be deleted.
                Consequently we need a definition of the m-tag component and an undertanding of its functionality

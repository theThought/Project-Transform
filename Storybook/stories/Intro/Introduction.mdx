# Project Transform Storybook
This is the component library for [Project Transform](https://zeroheight.com/61aada3a1/p/264eaa-project-transform).

## Code patterns
- The HTML is currently copied from the project's [staging server](https://zeroheight.com/61aada3a1/p/264eaa-project-transform) output, and simplified to provide working examples.
- The CSS/JavaScript code is currently loaded from the `./Survey` folder inside `.storybook/preview-head.html`.


## Accessibility testing
Storybook comes with 2 default accessibility testing tools:
- `Accessibility addon`. This is in Storybook's `addons` toolbar, and is built on the same [AxeCore API](https://www.deque.com/axe/) that Lighthouse uses.
- `Vision simulator`. This is in Storybook's main toolbar at the top of each story page.

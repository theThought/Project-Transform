# Project Transform Storybook
This is the component library for [Project Transform](https://zeroheight.com/61aada3a1/p/264eaa-project-transform).

## Code patterns
- The HTML is copied from the [project's staging server](https://online-stg.ipsosinteractive.com/mrIWeb/mrIWeb.dll?I.Project=S20223280&i.test=1).
    - Uses **source HTML**, prior to any JavaScript transformations caused by `custom properties` rendered in the source HTML.
    - Source HTML has been edited to provide simplified examples.
- The compiled CSS/JavaScript code is loaded inside `.storybook/preview-head.html`, directly from the repo's `./Survey` folder .
    - If JavaScript doesn't execute when a story is rendered, reload the browser.

## Toggling UI themes in Storybook
- Uses the `storybook-theme-switch-addon` button in Storybook's main toolbar (paint brush icon).
- This works in both local and published Storybooks.
- Theme CSS file paths are defined in `.storybook/preview.js`.

## Accessibility testing
Storybook comes with 2 default accessibility testing tools:
- `Accessibility addon`. This is in Storybook's `addons` toolbar, and is built on the same [AxeCore API](https://www.deque.com/axe/) that Lighthouse uses.
- `Vision simulator`. This is in Storybook's main toolbar at the top of each story page.

## TODO
- Improve HTML semantics with `<label>` and `<fieldset><legend>` for questions, and use `ARIA` to further enhance accessibility.
- Re-author Sass/JavaScript, and use better tooling to handle transpilation/bundling.

# Project Transform Storybook
This is the component library for [Project Transform](https://zeroheight.com/61aada3a1/p/264eaa-project-transform).

## HTML markup
- The HTML in each story is copied from [Project Transform's staging server](https://online-stg.ipsosinteractive.com/mrIWeb/mrIWeb.dll?I.Project=S20223280&i.test=1), using the **source HTML** - i.e. prior to any JavaScript transformations of the DOM via `custom properties`.
- In some cases, the source HTML has been simplified to produce cleaner examples.

### CSS/JavaScript, and Hot Module Reloading
- The compiled CSS/JavaScript code is loaded inside `.storybook/preview-head.html`, directly from this repo's `./Survey` folder.
- This means that Hot Module Reloading does not work - i.e. CSS/JavaScript changes are not automatically reflected in stories. Reload the current page.
- Similarly, JavaScript may not execute when loading a new story. Reload the page.

## Toggling UI themes in Storybook
- Uses the `storybook-theme-switch-addon` button in Storybook's main toolbar (paint brush icon).
- This works in both local and published Storybooks.
- Theme CSS file paths are defined in `.storybook/preview.js`.

## Accessibility testing
Storybook comes with 2 default accessibility testing tools:
- `Accessibility addon`. This is in Storybook's `addons` toolbar, and is built on the same [AxeCore API](https://www.deque.com/axe/) that Lighthouse uses.
- `Vision simulator`. This is in Storybook's main toolbar at the top of each story page.

## TODO
- Improve HTML semantics with `<label>` and `<fieldset><legend>` for questions, and use `ARIA` to further enhance accessibility.
- Re-author Sass/JavaScript, and use better tooling to handle transpilation/bundling.
- Leverage Hot Module Reloading.

# Icons
- Icons are applied as CSS background images.

## Single state icons
- For example, in [messages](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/molecules-messages--message-error&globals=theme:formal-theme).

## Multi state icons
- Used when displaying an icon as part of an interactive component.
- They have one of four possible states - unselected, selected, read only (unselected), read only (selected).
- For example, [custom checkboxes](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/molecules-options--option-multi&globals=theme:formal-theme) when they are selected.

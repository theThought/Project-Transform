## HTML markup


## CSS and JavaScript
- The compiled CSS/JavaScript code is loaded inside `./UI/.storybook/preview-head.html`, directly from this repo's `./Survey` folder.
- Storybook's `public` folder has been pointed at `staticDirs: ['../public', '../../Survey']` folders inside `./UI/.storybook/main.js`.

### Hot Module Reloading

## Toggling UI themes in Storybook

## Accessibility testing
Storybook comes with 2 default accessibility testing tools:
- `Accessibility addon`. This is in Storybook's `addons` toolbar, and is built on the same [AxeCore API](https://www.deque.com/axe/) that Lighthouse uses.
- `Vision simulator`. This is in Storybook's main toolbar at the top of each story page.

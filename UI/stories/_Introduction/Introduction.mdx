# Project Transform Storybook
This is Project Transform's component library.

## Code authoring guidelines & accessibility
- All UI components are authored with **semantic HTML5** markup.
- All CSS is vanilla. No pre-processors are used.
- Some components are **progressively enhanced** with JavaScript/TypeScript and `WAI-ARIA` as appropriate. <sup>1, 2</sup>
- Components are structured according to the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

> <sup>1</sup>
> The JavaScript-enhanced components have been authored as `HTML Web Components`, also known as `custom elements`.

> <sup>2</sup>
> To test how these enhanced components behave with JavaScript disabled, comment out the call to `uiInit()` in `src/javascript/index.ts`.

## Re-ordering stories in Storybook sidebar navigation
- All stories and docs are ordered according to the `storySort` configuration in `.storybook/preview.js`.

## CSS and JavaScript
- The compiled CSS/JavaScript code is loaded inside `./UI/.storybook/preview-head.html`.
- Storybook's `public` folder has been pointed at `staticDirs: ['../public', '../../Survey']` folders inside `./UI/.storybook/main.js`.

### Filepaths
- Storybook's static directory is defined by the `staticDirs: ['../public', '../../Survey']` array inside `.storybook/main.js`.

## Accessibility testing
Storybook comes with 2 default accessibility testing tools:
- `Accessibility addon`. This is in Storybook's `addons` toolbar, and is built on the same [AxeCore API](https://www.deque.com/axe/) that Lighthouse uses.
- `Vision simulator`. This is in Storybook's main toolbar at the top of each story page.

## Additional reading
- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
- [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/).

## TODO
- Setup fonts/images.
- Update Github workflow to publish this Storybook instance.

### TBC
- CSS naming convention - should we use BEM?
- Define naming convention for "primitive" design tokens, align with Figma, and implement automatic export.
- Implement new CSS theming mechanism with "whitelabel" default theme.
